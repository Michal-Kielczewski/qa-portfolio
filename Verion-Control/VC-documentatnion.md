# Version Control

This section showcases my use of GitHub for version control, with a primary focus on building, testing, and deploying automation scripts. Below are some key elements that demonstrate my approach to version control in a QA context:

## Branching Strategy
I use GitHub to manage branches primarily for developing and deploying automation scripts. Each branch represents a specific feature, automation update, or enhancement to ensure smooth integration into the QA repository. 

- **Automation branches:** Used for developing and updating automation tests.
- **Feature branches:** Managed for testing new features or enhancements in the automation pipeline.
- **Bugfix branches:** Used when resolving issues encountered during automation and unit testing.
